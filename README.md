# Running Examples

If you just want to view the examples, you can open the place.rbxl in Roblox Studio.

If you'd like to make changes to the files in this directory and see them reflected in Roblox Studio, you will need to setup [Rojo](https://rojo.space/). 

<details>
  <summary>Click for Rojo Usage Instructions</summary>
  Follow the installation instructions [here](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/). You must use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you install the Rojo VSCode extension, be sure to install the Rojo studio plugin as well. You can do this via the Rojo menu in VScode (⌘/ctrl+shift+p > Rojo: Open Menu > Instal Roblox Studio Plugin). Rojo runs a local http server for the Roblox Studio Rojo plugin to fetch your script changes from. To start this server, open the Rojo menu again (⌘/ctrl+shift+p > Rojo: Open Menu) and choose the last option to start the server for default.project.json (the project map file in this directory). Then, in the Roblox Studio Rojo plugin, connect to the server and all your changes here should automatically synchronize!
